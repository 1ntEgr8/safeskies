SafeSkies provides an easily accessible service to all passengers on a flight. It allows a user to send a ticket to the staff on board, which will then be answered via live chat. During the live chat, the client and staff discuss the situation and a plan of action is formed. The staff then ends the chat and the client is asked to follow the procedures as given by the on-board staff.
